    "#### 7.4.1.1. The `open()` Function\n",
    "The `open()` function creates a connection between your Python script and a file. This connection is sometimes called a _file stream_. The primary argument `open()` takes is a string: the location of the file you want to connect to. Once a file stream is opened, it must be closed for the file to be saved and accessed later. Python can connect to a file in various modes, the most basic of which are `'r'` (read mode) and `'w'` (write mode). \n",
    "\n",
    "Reading from (or writing to) a local file consists of three basic steps: open, read/write, and close. Remembering to close the file is an easy step to skip. Luckily, we don't have to remember to close the file if we use the `with` and `as` keywords to store the file stream in a temporary variable. Our code to read or write data is indented under the `with` statement, and the file will close automatically when the indented code runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of what a `with open()` block looks like. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('path/folder/filename.ext') as f:\n",
    "    variable_name = f.read()```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the slashes (`/`) separating the words in the `open()` function's argument. By default, Python will look for files in your current working folderâ€”the folder where your script or notebook is stored. If you want to read or write to a file in a different folder, you must include a _path_ to that folder. Most of the time, you'll use what's called the _relative path_. The relative path tells Python all the steps to take to get from the current working folder to the destination folder. Each step is separated by a slash (`/`) after each folder name. \n",
    "\n",
    "* To read a file, mode is `'r'` and the method is `.read()`. (This is the default mode, so if you don't pass a `mode` argument, the mode is `'r'`.)\n",

    "We've shown you how to read data from a single file, but what if we wanted to read data from a thousand files? When reading files individually is out of the question, use the Glob Library. The Glob Library allows you to grab all of the file names that match a specified pattern. Once you have the file names that you want to read, you can use a `for` loop to read each one in. The pattern that we pass to `.glob()` is a string that contains wildcard characters. The wildcards can stand in for any character or substring, thus allowing us to grab many files without typing their names explicitly. Take a look at the example below. As always, our use of Glob requires us to first import the library."

Then the data is available to read using one of the methods from this lesson. In other words, to read in data, all we need is a string that locates the file on your computer.  Helpfully, that's exactly what `.glob()` produces. The only trick is that `.glob()` gives you a list of those strings, and you have to loop through them and read each file individually. This means taking all of the code we use to read in a CSV file and indenting it underneath a `for` statement. In each run of our loop, we'll read in a single file and add its contents to a larger data collection."

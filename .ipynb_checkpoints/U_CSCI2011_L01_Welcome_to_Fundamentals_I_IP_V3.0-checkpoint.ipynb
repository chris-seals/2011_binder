    "Python is a widely used programming language for general-purpose programming. Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community: Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL).\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Syntax** - Syntax refers to how you write code, such as spacing, punctuation, and indentation.  Python depends on correct syntax to properly read and execute the code you write.  A single mistake in syntax will cause Python to execute the code differently than you intended or to throw an error, meaning Python will stop running your code and then give you an error message describing what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    ">REMEMBER: Computers are not smart; they are just really fast. Python syntax is designed to ensure there is no ambiguity in your instructions to the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variable** - A variable name is a stand-in for some data value.  Think back to when you learned to use \"x\" as a stand-in for numbers in math class.  Variables in code work just like this, but are more powerful.  A variable name in Python can be any letter, word, or series of words linked by underscores (`_`). Although you can use almost any word for variable names, the best practice is to be _descriptive_. Variables stand in not just for numbers, but also for text, Boolean values, lists of things, or any other type of data. To assign a data value to a variable in Python, we use a single equals sign, like `x = 4` or `some_text = 'Hello world!'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Comment** - A comment is text that is ignored by the computer. It is a description that provides more information about the thought process or logic that the code is representing. Any text that follows a pound sign (`#`) in a line of code will be considered a comment, and will not be evaluated by the computer. This allows us to leave notes for ourselves and other developers to reference."
